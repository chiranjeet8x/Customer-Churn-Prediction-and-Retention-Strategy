# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Retention-Strategy
This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn and developing actionable retention strategies. The goal is to help telecom companies identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive steps to retain them.

## üìÅ Project Objectives
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.

Perform extensive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to uncover patterns and correlations.

Build and evaluate various classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest).

Analyze feature importance and customer behavior.

Segment customers for targeted retention strategies using clustering techniques.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn,LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning (Classification, Clustering)

Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
